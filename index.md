# About

I am an associate professor in the department of computer science at the University of Salzburg, Austria. Prior to that, I was part of the medical imaging and computer vision group at Kitware Inc., North Carolina, USA. My research spans multiple areas (*machine learning*, *computer vision*, *medical imaging*), but mostly focuses on principled ways to leverage the inherent structure in all kinds of (mostly visual) data.
